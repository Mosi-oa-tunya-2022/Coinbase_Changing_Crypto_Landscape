## Overview and Origin

Coinbase, officially known as Coinbase Global, Inc. was incorporated in May 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam with the radical idea that anyone, anywhere, should be able to easily and securely send and receive bitcoin.

From the onset, the Bitcoin blockchain concept was very technical and buying bitcoin was a confusing and an intricate experience. The co-founders came up with this idea of democratizing access to the cryptoeconomy by enabling anyone with an Internet connection to easily and securely invest in and use crypto assets. Coinbase was initially funded through a Y Combinator, an American technology startup accelerator program, with a series of $50,000 investments, entrepreneur investment of $100,000 in bitcoin and later $2.5 million from venture capitalists.


## Business Activities:
Have you ever forgotten a password for your bank account, computer, mobile device or email? What if you lost your password, pin, or login credentials forever and no one is able to recover or reset the information for you? All your savings, valuable data, messages and notes gone forever! Bitcoin blockchain inventor or inventors with an alias of Satoshi Nakamoto described in their white paper how Bitcoin, the new decentralized technology, would not be controlled by a single person, company, government or a network on which the digital currency is built. It meant that people who bought and sold bitcoin could not depend on a bank or anyone else to manage their collection of digital money. Owning and managing bitcoin was cumbersome as it meant using something called a “private key” as well as a long senseless alpha numerical string that controlled access to one’s online digital wallet. If this key was lost, there was no recovery therefore, the key and money was gone forever. 

Simultaneously, today’s financial system relies upon a patchwork of intermediaries that spans banks, brokers, clearinghouses, custodians, exchanges, payment processors, and their networks to facilitate money movement, safekeeping, lending, credit, and other capital markets activity. The trust and reliance on this complex web of intermediaries imposes access limitations, efficiency huddles and added costs. It is the congruence of these two competing needs which made a business opportunity for Coinbase.

Brian’s idea which seemed radical at the time, was to provide a key management service for customers anywhere, anytime, to easily and securely send and receive Bitcoin, the first crypto asset. He built a website and mobile applications as a trusted platform for accessing Bitcoin and the broader crypto economy by reducing the complexity of the industry through a simple and intuitive user experience. There was resistance from the blockchain developer community as they perceived Brain’s idea as a deviation from the core concepts of blockchain. This was almost a decade ago and today, many companies are trying to emulate what Coinbase which is leap years ahead of the competition!  Traditional banks have specific operating hours (8am-5pm) whereas Coinbase is open 24/7 everywhere, an unfair competitive advantage.

In 2014, the company grew to one million users, acquiring the blockchain explorer service Blockr and the web bookmarking company Kippt. They also secured insurance covering the value of bitcoin stored on their servers, and launched the vault system to secure bitcoin storage. In addition, Coinbase Technologies include the following:

____________________________________________________________
Coinbase – Core Platform
Coinbase provides a simple and powerful REST API to integrate bitcoin payments into your business or application. They allow all major operations in bitcoin through one API.
CodebaseHQ 
It is the ultimate code hosting platform for professional development teams. Includes source tree browser, in-line comments, notes, and a powerful ticketing system. 
____________________________________________________________
MergeQueue 
It is a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue that manages the merge workflow for your Github repository. The MergeQueue bot (MQ bot) uses Github Labels to identify Pull Requests (PRs) that are ready to be merged and queues them up. The MQ bot then pulls the latest base branch for each of those PRs sequentially, runs and verifies the required status checks, and then merges the changes.
____________________________________________________________
Divjoy 
Divjoy is a React codebase & UI generator that gives everything needed for projects, including authentication, data fetching, payments (powered by Stripe), billing management, marketing pages, forms, and more.

detect-secrets 
detect-secrets is an aptly named module for detecting secrets within a code base. However, unlike other similar packages that solely focus on finding secrets, this package is designed with the enterprise client in mind: providing a backwards compatible, systematic means of: Preventing new secrets from entering the code base, Detecting if such preventions are explicitly bypassed, and Providing a checklist of secrets to roll, and migrate off to a more secure storage.
____________________________________________________________
Quasar Framework 
Build responsive Single Page Apps, SSR Apps, PWAs, Hybrid Mobile Apps and Electron Apps, all using the same codebase!, powered with Vue.
____________________________________________________________
Handlebars.js 
Handlebars.js is an extension to the Mustache templating language created by Chris Wanstrath. Handlebars.js and Mustache are both logicless templating languages that keep the view and the code separated like we all know they should be.
____________________________________________________________
Diez  
It is a free & open-source developer toolkit for expressing visual styles that can be shared across codebases, native platforms, and teams. It radically lowers the cost of delivering a consistent visual identity across native apps & websites.

.NET Core 
Cross-platform (supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux) and can be used to build device, cloud, and IoT applications.
____________________________________________________________
GuardRails 
Makes open-source security tools easily available in your Pull Requests. Continuously identifies security problems in your codebase and helps you fix them.
____________________________________________________________
Bearer 
Bearer helps security at teams tech companies build an inventory of their engineering services and data flows by scanning the codebase. So they can easily assess risks and identify gaps with their own security and privacy policies.
____________________________________________________________
Aura 
The Aura project centers around a collection of high-quality, well-tested, semantically versioned, standards-compliant, independent library packages that can be used in any codebase. 
____________________________________________________________
Hound 
Automated code review for GitHub pull requests. It comments on code quality and style issues, allowing you and your team to better review and maintain a clean codebase.
____________________________________________________________
 Psalm 
It is a type-checking static analysis tool for PHP that finds bugs humans can miss, and improves code quality. It is designed to be useful on both large legacy codebases and small, modern ones. It can help you prevent the vast majority of type-related runtime errors, and also enables you to take advantage of safe coding patterns popular in other languages.

## Landscape:
Coinbase’ customer are retail users, institutions and ecosystem partners providing a safe, trusted, and easy-to-use platform to invest, store (digital wallet), spend, earn, and use crypto assets. Currently, the platform enables approximately 73 million retail users, 7,000 institutions, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries to participate in the cryptoeconomy. For its retail users, Coinbase offers a free primary financial account on an easy-to-use platform to invest, store, spend, earn, and use crypto assets. It also provides institutions with hedge funds, money managers, and corporations a one-stop shop for accessing crypto markets through advanced trading and custody technology, built on top of a robust security infrastructure. Coinbase offers a state of the art marketplace with a deep pool of liquidity for transacting in crypto assets. It also prides itself with providing developers, merchants, and asset issuers a platform with technology and services that enables them to build applications that leverage crypto protocols, actively participate in crypto networks, and securely accept cryptocurrencies as payment to ecosystem partners.

Coinbase was the first crypto exchange and is directly integrated with over 15 blockchain protocols, supports over 90 crypto assets for trading or custody, and offers a suite of subscription products and services that have enhanced the customer value proposition and power of their platform. Coinbase has a trusted platform owing to their heritage of security and culture of regulatory compliance. They are a financial technology provider that offers services to customers in over 100 countries, and is one of the longest running crypto platforms where customers have not lost funds due to a security breach of the platform. They are also licensed to engage in money transmission and virtual currency business in almost all U.S. states and they continue to pursue licensing in select jurisdictions internationally.

Coinbase has a robust technology platform that enables unique product experiences for the industry. Their custom technology platform is built to deal with the real-time, global and 24/7/365 nature of crypto asset markets, enabling them to rapidly research, develop, and launch new products and features. Coinbase has soared in popularity and turned itself into the initial access point for mainstream crypto investors by positioning itself as a safe harbor among crypto asset exchanges. 




## Results

Coinbase is a crypto currency exchange which is taking the finance trading to a fascinating finish. It changed the financial landscape for good by liberating its customers from the restraints of giant banks and government-controlled money supplies. Coinbase has thoroughly pursued compliance with existing regulations and law enforcement, putting it on the right side of the law — another huge asset in a sector that is still in desperate need of regulatory guidance. They even earned an accolade for being crypto currency “white knights”. Coinbase’ success has been mimicked by bad actors who defrauded their customers and shady black market businesses like “Silk Roads” to facilitate illegal businesses. 

Cybersecurity, noticeably lacking at some of the exchanges has been Coinbase’ selling point.  For example, the Mt. Gox exchange in Japan went out of business in 2014 after hackers stole coins worth $480 million. Customers of QuadrigaCX, which was one of Canada’s largest exchanges, have been unable to retrieve $150 million in crypto since the founder supposedly died suddenly in December 2018, holding the only set of keys to unlock their money

Coinbase’ performance matrices are; 
-	Easy to use for cryptocurrency beginners:
 The main Coinbase website and mobile app are very easy to use and allow to buy, sell, and exchange cryptocurrencies quickly.
-	Support for a large number of cryptocurrencies: 
Coinbase currently supports over 100 currencies for trading, and the number grows regularly.
-	Opportunities to earn cryptocurrency: 
Earn interest on eligible balances, or get a small amount of a new currency through Coinbase Earn.
-	Lower pricing available with Coinbase Pro: 
Any user can switch to Coinbase Pro, an active trading platform with more features and low fees.


Despite the volatility of the crypto currencies, Coinbase is still a market leader in the world. The cryptocurrency marketplace is evolving quickly with new competitors. Major competitors to Coinbase include Gemini, Binance, KuCoin, FTX, Kraken, and many others. Coinbase features a top platform for anyone to buy, sell, store, and exchange cryptocurrency. It’s particularly good for beginners, who want a simple buying and selling experience without worrying about the complexities of external wallets and decentralized exchanges.



## Recommendations

One of the first recommendations for the company would be to improve their customer service. Currently, customers cannot speak to a “live” person if they needed technical help. I would also recommend incentives such as: 
1.	Loyalty reward points in form of cryptocurrencies 
2.	Pay interest on balances in the hot digital wallet.
3.	 Reduce fees and charges which are higher compared to the industry and could offer no international exchange fees
4.	Offer a cold unified wallet that could store multiple crypto currencies.  
5.	Just like Fiat transactions, Coinbase could liberate transactions further and provide complete anonymity for sale of goods and services. For example, If one bought a product in a store, no one cares where that Fiat is coming from or who owned it. With crypto, it is possible to trace who has spent what and when. 
6.	It could be an advantage for Coinbase to create a system where a customer who already has a digital wallet and a rapport with the exchange is not subject to waiting times for the transactions to take place. Instead, the exchange could lock-in rates at the time of transaction and operate like a modern Wall Street while ignoring the real time market volatility of crypto for real-time transactions. 
7.	Finally, Coinbase could offer virtual debit cards which could be preloaded with Fiat and then used to purchase goods and services without the insecurity of the volatility of crypto or transaction time lag. This virtual card or vault offering would broaden the acceptability and instant usage of crypto as the conversion from crypto currency to Fiat could be instant and shielded as the balances would be coming from the vault.

These suggested strategies would benefit Coinbase as some of their competitors are luring away core customers with such or similar version of offerings even though the competition does not have the command, security, rapport and versatility of Coinbase.
